# Algorithms

Basic algorithm and data structure implementations.
For example: stack, queue, linked list, binary search tree etc.

Also contains some simulations for some funny mathematical/statistical subjects, for example the [Monty Hall-problem](https://github.com/strahlistvan/algorithms/tree/master/MontyHallSimulator), the [Optimal stopping rule](https://github.com/strahlistvan/algorithms/tree/master/stoppingRule), or the [election calculator](https://github.com/strahlistvan/algorithms/tree/master/election_calculator) based on [d'Hondt-method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method).


I use C/C++ or sometimes Java or JavaScript languages for the algorithm implementations.
But I also have some simple and short program for Turing-machines,
written in the well-known [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) script language. To run them I recommend to use [this awesome visual interpreter](https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/).
