# Algorithms
Various basic algorithm and data structure implementations.
For example: stack, queue, linked list, binary search tree etc.


I use mostly C or C++ languages for the algorithm implementations,
But I also have some simple and short program for Turing-machines,
written in the well-known [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) script language.
