# Stopping Rule simulation - Toilet choosing example

This is a simple Java simulation of the optimal stopping rule. The problem also known as also known as the marriage problem, the sultan's dowry problem, the fussy suitor problem, the googol game, and the best choice problem.
In this example you need to find the cleanest toilet in the queue. You can examine one in a row, and you can accept or reject. If you reject one, you can not go back.

After some probability calculations, you can find that the probability to find the best one is maximal when you reject the first 37% and then choose the first one which is better then the best rejected.
