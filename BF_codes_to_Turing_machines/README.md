# Brainfuck scripts

- *add_two_numbers.bf* - Read two bytes from the standard input, then add the second one to the first.
(Increasing the first and decreasing the second while it is not zero)
- *n_zeroes.bf* - Read the length of the loop (n), and print n zeroes 
(Good example to understand Brainfuck/Turing Machine cycle)
- *dasistganzeabc.bf* - Print the alphabet to the standard output (screen) 
- *numbers_1_to_n.bf* - An other example for BF loops. 
   Print numbers from 1 to n with a single-tape Turing Machine in Brainfuck language
- *n_sum.bf* - Read the loop size (n) to the first pointer, then read n bytes.
 I read the first number to the seond pointer, then read the next number to the third place
 and add it to the second pointer's (accumulated) value in every loop.
 
 To try this scripts, I highly recommend to use this [Visual Brainfuck interpreter](https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/)
